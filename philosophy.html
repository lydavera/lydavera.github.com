<h3>The Age of Environmental Illnesses</h3>

<p>For the past several years I have had the good fortune to work with
doctors &ndash; medical and alternative &ndash; and have screened a
large number of people who were severely sick and could no longer
function efficiently in their daily lives. I have a specialized
computer system which enables me to screen the balance and imbalances
in body organs, glands and environmental sensitivities including
foods, chemicals, dusts, pollens, pets, etc. The system I currently
use is called the EQ4/Listen 10 and this system is approved with the
Health Protection Bureau in Canada, as a class 2 medical device. I
began working on the Interro, then moved onto the Omega Acubase and
changed to my present system. I've also worked with the Kindling 2000
devices.</p>

<p>The medical and alternative doctors that I have had the opportunity
to work with find this screening very helpful. It gives additional
information to their protocols which doesn't always show up with
blood, urine and hair analysis. For some types of blood and urine
analysis the patient must show specific levels of specific chemicals
for a problem to be detected. Bioenergetic screening will show
imbalances before a chronic level is evident or will confirm stress or
under functioning for specific organs and glands. It doesn't specify
amounts of physiological substances in the body, but will confirm if
there are sensitivities: high, low, or balanced, by a number
scale.</p>

<p>When an individual gets to the point of being unwell and can't get
over it, there are a number of ways to look at this problem.</p>

<ul>

<li><i>Find a medical doctor who you have confidence in</i> and have a
complete medical exam and whatever tests are recommended. There can be
hidden illnesses which haven't fully materialized and it is important
to eliminate what can be eliminated. Listen and follow their protocol,
for the time specified.</li>

<li>It is unraveling a puzzle, beginning with medical and family
history - genetic sensitivity/predisposition's, past or present
illnesses/weaknesses.</li>

<li>Look at your lifestyle:
<ul>
<li><a href="#nutrition">Nutrition</a></li>
<li><a href="#home">Home Environment</a></li>
<li><a href="#work">Work Environment</a></li>
<li><a href="#relaxation">Relaxation</a></li>
<li><a href="#exercise">Exercise</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<a name="nutrition"></a><h3>Nutrition</h3>

<p>Types of food, chemical additives, pesticides, irradiation. An
individual can say, "I am eating well and I don't abuse myself with
junk food and alcohol or recreational drugs." The underlying problem
can be a weakened digestive system, with imbalanced biochemistry to
digest properly. This translates to poor nutrition even if eating
perfectly. It is important to determine the status of the digestive
system, for assimilation and absorption. Vitamin and Mineral
supplements often go right through the body without breaking down.
This costs a lot of money for nothing and to no avail. Once the body
gets stronger and back on track a lot of supplementation can be
eliminated. The next step is to determine what foods and nutrients we
need to benefit from.</p>

<div class="note">
<h4>Important Note</h4>
<p>It is not easy, because a lot of people do not want to be bothered
with lifestyle changes. <i>"Just give me a pill or a quick fix, so I
can keep on with the life I like to lead."</i></p>
</div>

<a name="home"></a><h3>Home Environment</h3>

<p>Some individuals become so sensitive to their environment that
everything bothers them.  This includes, pets, carpets, wall paint,
construction materials, odors, perfumes, literally everything. Family
stress/emotions directly effect specific organs and glands as well. As
a result, it becomes difficult to identify or pinpoint any specific
item. From the point of screening I usually concentrate on the body
systems and glands and foods. Once a person is chronically sensitized,
the immune system is almost non-functioning. There is usually an
extreme toxic overload in the body and nutritional deficiency.  A
myriad of symptoms will result, such as depression, eczema, diarrhea,
fatigue, chronic fatigue, migraines, mood swings, anger, etc. The body
is in a complete state of stress and from my screening perspective all I
can get is stress readings. A beginning step is to have the
electrodermal screening done to determine your specific "blueprint"
of energetic balances and imbalances.</p>

<div class="note">
<h4>Important Note</h4>
<p>Each individual is unique and may need specific treatments. It
is important to follow the program of a professional doctor or
naturopath/homeopath for guidance when in a state of extreme
illness.</p>
</div>

<a name="work"></a><h3>Work Environment</h3>

<p>Our work place is another myriad of influences that can benefit or
inhibit our sense of well being. What are the influences from your
work place?  Chemicals, fluorescent lighting, computer's
electromagnetic fields, high tension wires, perfumes, animals,
emotional stress, hospital sicknesses, foods/chemical additives, dust,
stress, stress, stress. <b>Stress</b> alone translates into many
different emotions and again specific organs and glands receive
negative information and the functioning of these systems become
impaired.</p>

<a name="relaxation"></a><h3>Relaxation</h3>

<p>Learning how to relax these days without alcohol and medical or
recreational drugs is almost a lost art. There are many schools on
this subject, of course. One of the most effective ways to relax is
learning how to breathe properly and visualization techniques. Each
person will find their own way to relax depending on our personalities
and requirements.</p>

<p>If you are a person who travels out of the country, it is possible
to pick up amoebaes, parasites, and other organisms. Confirmation and
treatment is essential for wellbeing.</p>

<a name="exercise"></a><h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>The awareness of getting in shape physically is obvious and a
personal choice. It is unfortunate in this age of computers and videos
that we are not outside enough and not breathing deeply enough. Some
doctors I have worked with believe that the sun and country side with
flowers and trees feed a level of our being that stimulates our master
glands which in turn balance our body systems.</p>

<h3>Summation</h3>

<p>So far we have looked at the medical/genetic aspect, nutrition,
home environment and the work environment, relaxation, and exercise.
Combinations of these may contribute to "environmental illness."</p>

<p>Generally speaking we live too much inside artificial environments
and eat artificial foods, all with good intent and a lot of the time
not realizing how all this is effecting us until we get ill to the
point of almost no return. It is difficult to find doctors who know
how to treat these types of illnesses. This information is the base
for a lot of sicknesses and disease.  It has been often said, <i>"Once
the body is balanced it has the ability to heal itself."</i></p>

<p>There is no simple solution but a combination of steps which are
not a quick fix and requires a real effort on the part of the
individual to stick to it and try it for at least one month and
longer. Usually by one month changes are apparent and wellness is
starting to become stronger and stronger. <i>It is not easy trusting
this advice because it is not a quick fix.</i></p>

<p>All I can say is, <i>"I have seen this approach to healing work
where no other way succeeded."</i></p>
