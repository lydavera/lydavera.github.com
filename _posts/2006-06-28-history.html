<h2>History</h2>

<h3>Brief</h3>

<p>Originally, ElectroDermal Screening was called
"Electro-acupuncture According to Voll" (EAV). Developed around 1950
by Dr. Reinhold Voll, engineer, medical doctor, dental surgeon,
homeopath, and acupuncturist. Electro-acupunture is a comprehensive
term for all procedures based on measurements or therapy derived from
Chinese acupuncture, using modern electronics.</p>

<h3>Approximate Timeline</h3>

<dl>
<dt>2750 BC</dt>
<dd>Egyptian tombs describing the use of electric eels are the first
reported case of electricity in medicine.</dd>

<dt>1600 AD</dt>
<dd>English physician William Gilbert coins the term "electric" and
establishes the difference between electricity and magnetism.</dd>

<dt>1831 AD</dt>
<dd>Carlo Matteucci, professor of physics at Pisa, shows that
electrical current is generated by injured muscles. </dd>

<dt>1858 AD</dt>
<dd>Dr. Francis, Philadelphia physician, describes relief of dental
pain by electricity. May 25, 1858, he receives a patent for Galvanism,
denounced by the College of Physicians and Surgeons, however his
methods spread through America and Europe.</dd>

<dd>W.G. Oliver of Buffalo, discoveres 'electrical anesthesia',
reporting a 98% success rate using a vibrating generator for dental
pain.</dd>

<dt>1892 AD</dt>
<dd>Sir William Osler's "The Principles and Practice of Medicine"
describes many uses of electricity in medicine.</dd>

<dt>1942 AD</dt>
<dd>Reinhold Voll, German medical doctor, develops an electronic
testing device for finding acupuncture points electrically. Voll
dedicates his life to identifying correlations between disease states
and changes in the electrical resistance of the various acupuncture
points.</dd>

<dt>1953 AD</dt>
<dd>Werner and Voll develop an instrument for applying
electro-acupuncture to the skin without the use of needles. This
instrument is able to locate acupuncture points, render them
electrically measurable, enable the electric treatment to be given and
then to be re-measured electrically to assess the effect of the
treatment.</dd>

<dt>1954 AD</dt>
<dd>The Pitterling company introduces the Dermatron, the first device
for the general market.</dd>

<dt>1956 AD</dt>
<dd>M.L. Kindling develops new features of the technology and expands
its horizons. Kindling creates Bioelectric Function Diagnosis (BFD),
which drops from 180 points to 56 and uses simpler
methodologies.</dd>

<dt>1970 AD &ndash; ongoing</dt>
<dd>Dr. William Tiller, professor in the Dept. of Science and
Engineering at Stanford University, studies electrodermal
devices extensively. He writes extensively in an attempt to
explain the electric behavior of the skin and how electrodermal
diagnostic and treatment instruments function.</dd>

<dt>1978 AD</dt>
<dd>Floyd Weston gives Mr. P. Peterson and Mr. J. H. Clark the second
Dermatron in the U.S. and asks for it to be computerized. </dd>

<dt>1980 AD</dt>
<dd>J.H. Clark develops the Accupath.</dd>

<dt>1984 AD</dt>
<dd>J.H. Clark develops the Interro, a second generation screening device.</dd>

<dt>1987 AD</dt>
<dd>W. Nelson develops the Eclosion device.</dd>

<dt>1990 AD</dt>
<dd>J.H. Clark develops the Listen 10 System, a third generation
screening device.</dd>

<dt>1994 AD</dt>
<dd>W. Nelson develops the Quantum Xrroid.</dd>

<dd>R. Eanes develops the Avatar.</dd>

<dt>1996 AD</dt>
<dd>Wolley Brothers buy the Eclosion and produce the Phazx.</dd>

<dt>1998 AD</dt>
<dd>BioMeridian/Digitial Health develops "Best System" screening device.</dd>

<dd>J.H. Clark develops the EQ4, a fourth generation screening device.</dd>

<dt>2001 AD</dt>
<dd>Kindling introduces redesigned Kindling 2000.</dd>
