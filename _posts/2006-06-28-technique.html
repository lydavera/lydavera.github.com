<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The <abbr title="Computerized ElectroDermal Screening">CEDS</abbr>
screening may be scanned or recorded depending on the type of
equipment used.</p>

<p>The following technique is a description on how to use a stylus,
electrode and ohmeter within the CEDS devices. The computer records
the readings as a number between 0-100.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Ohmmeter</dt>
<dd>The ohmmeter is an instrument for measuring directly electrical
resistance in ohms. The ohm is named after the physicist Georg Simon
Ohm (1789-1854). An ohm is a practical unit of electrical resistance,
equal to the resistance of a circuit in which a electro-motive force
of one volt maintains a current of one ampere.</dd>

<dt>Ohm's Law</dt>
<dd>States that the steady current through certain electric circuits
is directly proportional to the applied electromotive force.</dd>

<dt>Electrons</dt>
<dd>Electricity is the movement of electrons. Electron Theory places
the protons and neutrons at the center, or nucleus, of the atom with
electrons orbiting around it. Electrons are the basic negative charge
of electricity, and a single electron is predicted to weigh 1845 times
less than a proton, so its weight has a negligible effect on the
atom's total weight. The model of the atom shows bigger atoms having
electrons orbiting in shells that are further and further from the
nucleus. The electrons in outer shells are loosely held, and since
they can be easily dislodged, they are called free electrons.
According to the theory, when these free electrons flow, they form an
electric current.</dd>

<h3>Acupuncture Meridians and Points</h3>

<p>Organ networks communicate with each other via an invisible web of
channels transporting Qi (chi) and blood. The Qi courses through the
body in perpetual motion similar to water in a riverbed. Like the
matrix of waterways that cover the face of the earth, these channels
empty into one another, intersect, and have underground as well as
surface streams, connecting the interior with the exterior of the
body.</p>

<p>Acupuncture points are located in small depressions in the skin
called "men" or "gates". Access can be gained to the internal
circulation of Qi and blood through acupuncture points. In ancient
times, when Chinese cities were fortified by walls, gates were opened
to receive sustenance and closed to keep harm away. Acupuncture points
are gateways, subtle portals of the body that are opened and closed to
adjust its dynamic.</p>

<p>Thin, solid, sterile stainless steel needles enter the channels,
activating or inhibiting the flow of Qi and blood. Fourteen major
pathways traverse the principal acupuncture points located below the
elbow and knee - where the Qi changes its polarity from Yin to Yang
and gathers force as it moves from the extremities toward the
core. Stimulation of these points exerts profound influence upon the
equilibrium of the organism as a whole.</p>

<h2>Procedure of CEDS Screening</h2>

<h3>What is being measured on the acupuncture points?</h3>

<p>The flow of electrons through related body parts via meridian
pathways in the body. This is the science of acupuncture and
electricity and physics.</p>

<h3>How to measure using the electrode and stylus</h3>

<p>Apply moisture to the brass electrode and place it in the client's
opposite hand from the side to be measured. The client should hold the
ground comfortably. The client's arm and hand should have support so
the client can hold the ground without tiring and stressing the
arm.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Operator Contact</dt>
<dd>The operator holds firmly and comfortably the finger or foot/toe
in question to have the probe applied to.  The operator, while holding
the finger or toe, stabilizes the probe with their hand holding the
probe. The operator's middle, ring and small fingers or side of the
hand may be touching and this acts in a pivotal fashion so the
operator can control the amount of pressure applied by the probe, as
using a pen.</dd>

<dt>Stylus Angle</dt>
<dd>The angle of the probe is important and should be perpendicular to
the contour of the bone. Bones are not flat surfaces and each person is
unique in the shape and size of their bones. The contact of the
probe/stylus must produce a round, equal circle on the skin
surface.</dd>

<dt>Conductance Point</dt> 
<dd>The acupuncture point is the point of conductance and this value
is recorded or displayed on a volt meter depending on what type of
system is being used in the point testing. There is audio support with
a sound emission going from a low tone to a higher pitch which aids
the practitioner to determine the correct reading. The speed at which
the sound goes form low to high is also an indicator for helping the
operator to conclude a conductance test. Some technicians rely on the
visual record rather than the sound signal.</dd>

<dt>Skin Humidity</dt>
<dd>Effects the point reading. A slight amount of moisture is required
for conductance on the surface of the skin. The application of water
may be applied with a sponge or sprayer or by dipping in a small
container. The electrode may be wrapped in a sterilized, wet gauze or
other material to retain moisture during the measurement.</dd>

<dt>Point Location</dt>
<dd>There are charts displaying the hand, foot or body showing where
the acupuncture points are. Physically it takes training to know where
the points are in relation to the joints and bone. The audio indicator
is also important to aid the operator. Once the point is located there
is a rise of tone to a high pitch, once the highest pitch is attained,
it is suggested to remove any excess moisture on the point and retake
the reading again to confirm the information is stable.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>How does it operate?</h3>

<p>The patient holds a ground electrode in one hand and the operator
contacts a point on the patient's opposite hand or foot. This
procedure is non-invasive, no needles are used. The patient becomes
part of a closed electrical circuit. The electrons flow from the
ground electrode of the ohmmeter through the cable and the patient and
back through the probe, which contacts the skin. During a visit, the
operator first measures base resistance values of the acupuncture
points. The base resistance values show the present energy pattern of
the patient at that moment. Because the resistance values are big
numbers, Voll established a scale.</p>

<h3>Applying the correct amount of pressure with the stylus</h3>

<p>Dr. Voll, in his studies determined that there is a pressure
plateau which is evident on the software graph while applying the
stylus to the acupuncture point. The reading rises from a minimum
point to a maximum point, stabilizes and falls, recording a true
reading numerically of energetic function of whatever the specific
point may be.  When the pressure plateau is reached for a specific
point the conductance value will remain constant or fall even when
pressure is initially increased on the stylus tip. The operator must
be careful as excessive pressure can cause irritated or broken
skin. If the skin is irritated or broken at the acupuncture point the
readings will be influenced certainly. Hand lotions and creams also
influence the exactness of the acupoint reading. By listening to the
sound indicator, watching the pressure plateau on the screen or
voltmeter, the operator may be confident of a correct reading.</p>

<h3>How to Interpret the numeric readings</h3>

<dl>

<dt>Rate of Rise</dt>
<dd>Begins from zero, and may end anywhere up to 100. The speed of
movement in this column is relevant information.</dd>

<dt>Maximum</dt>
<dd>The collection of electrons reaches a plateau and records from
zero to 100.</dd>

<dt>Minimum</dt>
<dd>After the reading is recorded numerically or visually seen on a
voltmeter, the reading falls to a minimum reading.</dd>

<dt>Rate of Fall</dt>
<dd>Once the maximum reading plateaus and records or is seen at a stable
point, the reading may fall at a specific rate which is pertinent
information for the operator, practitioner. This value defines the
duration after the maximum reading is taken and is calculated from the
highest conductance value during the measurement.</dd>
