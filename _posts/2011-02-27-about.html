<h2>Lyda V. Snyder, E.D.S.P., N.H.P.</h2>

<p>Lyda is an electrodermal screening practitioner and natural therapist
working with state of the art computer equipment called the EQ-4/Listen 10
System developed in Salt Lake City, Utah by James Hoyt Clark, Bioengineer. The
original technology was developed by Dr. Reinhold Voll M.D., engineer, and
acupuncturist, in Germany, who also developed electro-acupuncture devices in
the 1950s.</p>

<p>She has a specific technique and assessment to give an energetic blue print
of an individual's body/organ systems and environmental sensitivities. This
information is invaluable and a key to help establish wellness and balance for
a Healthy quality of life.</p>

<p>Lyda has worked in the allopathic and alternative fields for over 17 years.
Initially her journey began when she was taking care of her elderly parents.
The medical system was failing in many ways to help her aging parents with
their very serious ailments. Her journey of learning about naturopathy,
homeopathy plus many other modalities to assist them came to light. Her
parents health conditions finally stabilized. They were able to experience
wonderful improvements which enabled them to enjoy a much better quality of
life in their Golden years. </p>

<p>Computerized Electro dermal Screening was one of these modalities and she
has mastered, using 4 different screening systems, beginning with the Interro,
Amega Acubase, Listen 10/EQ4, and the Kindling 2000 series of electro dermal
equipment. This is wonderful tool to help assess different health conditions,
remedies, environmental/ food sensitivities and specialized items. A unique
"Blue Print", for each individual can be provided with the screening.</p>

<p>Throughout the 17 years of studying and applying this technology she has
taken a wide variety of courses both medical and alternative. She has taken
courses as a Natural Therapist dealing with Nutrition, Classical and Complex
Homeopathy, Kinesiology, Colour therapy, Past lives influence, Negative energy
clearing, Acupressure, Touch for health, Herbal tinctures, Radionic
Homeopathy, Intuitive Readings, Meditation and Neuro Linguistic
Programming.</p>

<p>On the allopathic side, Lyda specializes in working with special needs
teenagers in an inclusive school setting as a Special Needs Educational
Assistant. She has great success with these students by using "Outside of the
Box" techniques with them. She also teaches English and French to Korean
English Language Learners in a private Korean school.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, we all should be able to have the choice of combining
preventative, alternative and allopathic medicines for our health concerns and
ongoing wellness. <b>Self-empowerment enables an individual to take control and
responsibility for their own heath situations, thereby setting a new trend in
health awareness.</b> </p>
