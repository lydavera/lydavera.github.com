<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>How reliable is electrodermal screening?</h3>

<p>There is a great deal of controversy in medicine today over the
issue concerning techniques which are considered experimental, and
which ones are to be adequately proven. There have been a variety of
double blind studies using the electrodermal technology with very
positive results in a number of countries including the U.S., Germany,
Japan, China, France, Denmark, and Russia. There are many research
papers and books written on this subject for example, 'Vibrational
Medicine' by Dr. Gerber</p>

<h3>What Do Bioenergetic Devices Do?</h3>

<p>They measure a direct or indirect biological response to an evoked
potential, which is the response of the body to energy or a change in
energy. The response allows muscles, tendons, ligaments, cells,
fluids, to move and the five senses to function and respond.</p>

<h3>Is this Technology valid? Yes!</h3>

<p>The technology is based on galvanic skin resistance, measuring skin
resistance with an ohmeter. It has been shown that skin resistance is
between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 ohms, while at the acupuncture points,
the resistance drops between 96,000 and 100,000 ohms in a balanced
system.  Research by Drs.  Voll, Tiller, Tsuei, Pomeranz, Boucsein,
Schaefer, Neijenhusen, Reichmanis, Marino & Becker and others all
prove that the meridians and acupuncture points do exist and are valid
points to use for evaluation.</p>

<h3>What is ElectroDermal Screening (EDS)?</h3>

<p>Originally this technology was called Electro-acupuncture According
to Voll, (EAV), developed around 1950 by Dr. Reinhold Voll, engineer,
medical doctor, dental surgeon, homeopath and acupuncturist.</p>

<p>Is the measurement of the energetic resistance of specific
acupuncture points mainly on both hands and feet displaying
numerically, energetic imbalances of a person and further determine
specific products or techniqueswhich may help bring balance back into
the body systems. Originally Voll's method consisted of measuring 180
points on the hands, feet and face. A pressure of 450 grams is applied
and the reading is observed until a plateau is accessed. The energetic
curve to reach this plateau determines the quality of the system being
measured. Through Kindling, in Germany, other advances were made and
the Bioelectric Function Diagnosis (BFD) approach was created.  BFD
dropped from 180 points to 56, and used other simplified
methodologies.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Electro-acupunture</dt>
<dd>is a comprehensive term for all procedures based on measurements
or therapy derived from Chinese acupuncture, using modern
electronics.</dd>

<h3>What is electro-acupuncture according to Voll?</h3>

<p>This is testing with a low voltage electrical charge which is
introduced into the body, and the precise level of electric current
conducted through the acupuncture points are measured. It includes
information about various organ systems and musculoskeletal regions
obtained by the numeric level of the readings.  Various stimuli may be
introduced, and any change in electrical conductance at various
acupuncture points provides useful diagnostic information.</p>

<p>In reference to Ohm's Law, the models of the electrical equivalent
circuits compare the electrical characteristics of components found in
electronic devices. These electrical characteristics of components
found in electronic devices also compare to the electrical
characteristics of the body, which include resistance (conductance)
and capacitance, which is caused when a barrier produces a buildup of
a charge. The equivalent circuit shows that the body has electrical
characteristics which change with dynamic ion concentrations, tissue
permeability, cell-membrane binding and transport, and other
functions. Engineers and scientists use these models to explain how
the skin conductance measurement and EDS work.</p>

<p>The studies of Voll, Teichmanis, Tiller, Schimmel, and others have
found than an inflammation of an organ causes increased ion
concentrations. The increase of ions enhances the flow of electrons,
so the resistance increases the conductance decreases. Tiller also
found that after a current is applied for a few seconds, the
resistance, may increase because the ion concentrations change. This
causes the conductance to fall, which models the Indicator Drop (ID)
of Voll.</p>

<h3>What Energy is being screened in the body?</h3>

<p>Processes in the body begin with energy and the structure and
function of the body are sustained by energy. A biological process,
including eating or illness, changes the structure or function of the
body and causes the electrical resistance to change.</p>

<p> The change of the flow of electrons from one electrode to the
other electrode provides a profile of the balance or imbalance of the
meridians of the body. When flow of electrons is above or below the
optimal value, there is an imbalance. By applying the stimulus of the
probe the flow of electrons is registered by the ohmmeter, in a state
of balance or imbalance. A different stimulus may be selected within
the program to balance the flow of electrons, this may be done by
determining a remedy, or cause of an imbalance or applying a treatment
depending on which modules of equipment are used.</p>

<h3>What is the Measuring scale?</h3>

<p>Starts at 0 and goes up to 100. The value of 50 shows that the
point measured is well balanced. Values over 60 up to 100 show
inflammations of various stages. Values under 50 down to 10 show
weaknesses and degeneration.  Values under 10 are virtually never
found. The indicator drop after arriving at the maximum plateau, may
drop quickly, slowly or evenly. This gives specific information for
the operator.</p>

<h3>Who can use this technology?</h3>

<p>A wide range of individuals may use this technology for information
purposes in addition to other medical or non-medical applications for
acquiring information. Countries, provinces and states may have
specific regulations in terms as to whom may use these devices
depending on government registration, or not. The professional doctor
or practitioner may acquire information in addition to other
sources.</p>

<p>Electrodermal testing systems utilize different energetic linkups
with an energy reference bank containing substances being tested on
acupuncture points for acupuncture point resonance effects. There are
contained holding areas for testing remedies and multiple remedies
recording meridian reasonance phenomena via a handheld acupoint
probe. Frequencies of subtle energy directly enter into the body's
meridians via special circuitry within the devices in order to find
frequencies, which balance the unbalanced energetic
system. (Gerber)</p>

<h3>What are the Advantages and Disadvantages of eletro-dermal
screening?</h3>

<p>Certain pharmaceutical medications can effect the readings during a
screening session. By observation, some medications may suppress a
person's immune reactivity, resulting in false positive or other
readings on the instrument.  Skin testing may be suppressed in the
same way, from hand lotions, which may have an insolating effect.</p>

<p>False readings may also occur in response to chemicals in the
environment in which testing occurs such as reactions to perfumes,
cleaners, etc..  Occasionally, for unknown reasons, the instrument
fails to identify a food, chemical or inhalent to which a person by
history repeatedly reacts.</p>

<p>The equipment is not clairvoyant, in determining all the possible
reasons for ascertaining a particular reading. It assists by
collecting energetic information to help determine pieces of a complex
puzzle.</p>

<h3>What is VEGA testing?</h3>

<p>The vega-test methods were invented in 1978. The science of
vega-test techniques is called bio-energetic regulatory
techniques. The technique developed out of the principles of
electro-acupuncture and medicament testing.</p>

<p>The practitioner no longer works on the many organ/gland
measurement points but uses organ ampoules in a homeopathic D4
potency. The measurements are made on the measurement points, Allergy
1 or the Connective Tissue Degeneration 1, or Triple Warmer 1, right
or left hand may be chosen for these points testing.</p>

<p>There are a variety of test kits available for testing on the
mentioned test points for specific information.</p>

<p>The equipment consists of a voltmeter, testplate/honeycomb for
product, an electrode and stylus.</p>

<h3>How is an acupuncture point identified, through EDS?</h3>

<p>Acupuncture points can be found by introducing a low voltage
electrical charge into the body and then measuring the electrical
resistance of the skin. The acupuncture points are more conductive or
have less electrical resistance than the surrounding tissue.</p>

<p>Topographically, the measuring points are located with reference to
certain fixed osseous points &ndash; usually the transition zone
between the shaft and capitulum, or in the interstices of myofascial
planes at the margins of muscles and tendons. The actual point is
located on the skin 2-3 mm deep in the corium or subcutaneous
tissue. Sufficient pressure is applied over the point to establish the
degree of reproducibility of maximum artifact.</p>

<p>The instrument also has to yield a current polarized in the
opposite electrical charge to that of the body. The current must be
small or it will distort the measurement and change the physiology of
the body. The positive pole is usually the stylus. EAV diagnosis is
based on sending direct current obtained from a current source with a
high internal resistance through the body using an exactly calibrated
value derived from a phantom. Measurement carried out by this direct
current as stimulus is a functional test just strong enough provoke a
healthy body to bring about an equilibrium between the stimulus and
its own reaction (stable value).</p>

<p>The hand electrode is placed in the patient's hand, while the
stylus is stroked to the point of maximum deflection and then a
measurement pressure is put on the acupoint. The indicator will drop
back towards a lower value.  This dropping back to a lower value is
called an Indicator Drop (ID) and represents the most important
reading in EAV. All IDs must be treated first.</p>

<p>Four consecutive points on each meridian must be measured in order
not to miss an ID on a single point. Individual points may be used to
diagnose problems with specific parts of specific organs. The hand
electrode should be held on the same side that is being measured when
meassuring the feet. A number of different results can be obtained
from a reading of the acupoint.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Balanced Reading</dt>
<dd>Input voltage is matched by organ outpt voltage to give a reading
of 50 (scale 0-100)</dd>

<dt>An irritated or inflamed reading</dt>
<dd>&gt;60 due to excess discharge from the irritated organ, the
intruding current exceeds the capacitance of the organ.</dd>

<dt>A degenerative reading</dt>
<dd>Initial normal or inflamed reading followed by an indicator drop
(ID), that shows degeneration of the involved organ. An indicator drop
below 30 is serious.</dd>

<dt>A low reading or no reading</dt>

<dd>due to organ inability to respond at all, a case of advanced
degeneration.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The rate of rise of the indicator gives an indication of the state
of energy within the organ. The slower the rate of the rise the less
energy can be mobilized to balance the intruding current &ndash; the
organ is fatigued.</p>
