<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>Computerized electrodermal screening measures the degree of
electrical resistance at specific acupuncture points on the fingers
and toes, recording galvanic skin resistance. There are no <b>no
needles</b>, electrical shocks, or invasive techniques used. The
computer converts the skin resistance response to a number. The range
of numbers indicates balance and imbalance. A print out and
explanation is included with each client's report following their
screening information. This system is marketed as a non-invasive,
biofeedback or Tens device, which screens for variations in galvanic
skin resistance.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>Lyda V. Snyder, <abbr title="Electro-Dermal Screening Practitioner">E.D.S.P.</abbr>, 
<abbr title="Natural Healing Practitioner">N.H.P.</abbr> is certified electrodermal
screening practitioner with <b>17 years of experience</b> in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. She is available
by appointment only, please <a

<h4>Important Note</h4>
<p>This is not a medical diagnosis, it is an alternate source of
information. The EQ4/Listen 10 system is registered with the Health
Protection Bureau of Canada as a class 2 medical device.</p>

<h2>Science</h2>

<p><abbr title="Computerized ElectroDermal Screening">CEDS</abbr> is
the field of science pertaining to Bioenergy Medicine or
Bioeletromagnetics. Bioenergetics is the field of biology that studies
energy. Biological energy is information processing. The information
is processed by chemical and electrical reactions. Bioenergetics using
conductance comprises the procedures and the instrumentation for
obtaining numerical information about the status of the body through
conductance measurements. Bioenergetics is new because the remedies,
tools and techniques have recently been brought together. Remedies are
herbs, homeopathics, combinations and pharmaceuticals with
bioenergetics. Tools are observations, meridians and anatomy and
physiology, computer with bioenergetics. Techniques are observations,
symptoms and lifestyle observations with bioenergetics.</p>

<p>CEDS devices use electrons to measure changes in resistance. The
electrons are introduced at one electrode that is contacting the skin
and pass through the body to an electrode at another location on the
skin. The protocol enables the operator to separate out or screen
energy imbalances. The technique of screening, uses products and
substances in conjunction with the electromagnetic fields to screen
for help to balance the body.</p>
